# odin-landing-page
This is my iteration of the Landing Page Project from TOP.

For this project I decided to use the base model as a boilerplate for a portforlio
landing page. 

I decided to change a couple of things by for example adding :hover css on CTAs 
and links to make the site more interactive.

This boilerplate will probably be used as the basis for a future portfolio with 
different projects.
